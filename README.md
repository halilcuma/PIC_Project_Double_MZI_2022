# PIC_Project_Double_MZI_2022
The design and analyze of three MZI and a Double-MZI with different phase-shift is presented.

Circuit desing Implementation:

The technology used for constructing the circuits is from Australian Silicon Photonics (ASP) PDK.
A standard waveguide template and directional coupler from ASP were used.
AutoPlaceAndConnect was used to hookup all the circuits.
Analyze the circuit:

# Design parameters

- First MZI delay length $\Delta L_1 = 15 \mu m$
- Second MZI delay length $\Delta L_1 = 150 \mu m$
- Forth MZI*  delau length $\Delta L_1 = 0.337 \mu m$ 
* The fourth MZI designed to form an MZI that performs resonance at wavelength = 1.55 Âµm
- Power coupling for the directional couplers: 25%, 50%, 75%
